						<div class="sponsor-image"><a href="https://showx.io/" target="_blank"><img src="assets/sponsors/showx.png" /></a></div>
						<p class="sponsor-desc">At ShowX, we’re passionate about tech talent. We want to give coders from all backgrounds the chance to learn, collaborate and showcase their ability to some of the world’s top employers - because ultimately, the tech industry needs to change the way it hires tech talent. We can no longer afford to screen candidates by which university they went to, discriminate against gender or look for coders based on experience. Without change, great candidates will remain hard to find, the skills shortage will continue to grow and diversity will never be achieved.</p>
